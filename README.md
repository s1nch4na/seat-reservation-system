# seat-reservation-system

Brief Description

This program is a seat reservation system designed to manage bookings efficiently. It allows users to view available seats, reserve seats, and cancel reservations through a simple and interactive menu. The program ensures smooth operation by validating user inputs and keeping track of seat statuses in real-time. It is a practical example of using arrays and basic logic to solve real-world problems.

Contribution

I played a key role in developing the seat reservation system by writing most of the core source code. This included adding features like reserving and canceling seats, checking availability, and making sure the program runs smoothly. I also worked on organizing the code into simple, reusable functions and added checks to handle errors and user inputs properly. On top of that, I helped with the report by making sure everything was clearly explained and easy to follow.
